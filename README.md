A project I started while at Le Wagon Coding Bootcamp. It is a platform that enable users to publicly
donate to podcast episodes via a Twitter-esque UX. Users get a 10% cut of any donations that occur
by the influence of their donation (a re-donation if you will). Thus giving the user the potential
to actually earn money by way of donating to **quality** podcast episodes.

Future Development
------------------
I never finished implementing payments and intend on re-creating this project on top of the Lightning
Network to enable the potential for micro-transactions.
